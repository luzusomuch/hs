			<h3>Personal information</h3>
			<p>You have to enter your name and email address during the registration process (hereinafter: “Data”).</p>
			<p>In addition, you can voluntarily add to the information during the registration process and later in the profile. This includes data such as profile picture, gender, age, location, leisure interests or other information about your person (hereinafter: “Voluntary Data”).

			<h3>Cookies</h3>
			<p>Cookies are small text files that are sent along with the actually requested data from the Internet to your computer. There the data is stored and kept available for later retrieval.</p>
			<p>When you visit our site, we use session cookies and persistent cookies.</p>
			<p>The session cookie that is placed at every page request is only available during your online session and becomes inactive as soon as you close your browser software. It is only needed for technical communication between the browser and the Web server. Our cookies do not contain IP addresses.</p>
			<p>You have the option to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies. You can adjust your browser settings, however, so that it will refuse cookies. Information on how the browser can be configured accordingly can be found at the following link: <a href="http://hilfe.telekom.de/...." target="_blank">http://hilfe.telekom.de/....</a></p>
			<p>If you reject cookies in general, it can lead to problems in the use of our services or you cannot use any of the other interactive features of certain web sites and services provided by cookies.</p>
			<p>For one, we use persistent cookies to improve and to personalise our service. Moreover, the analysis tools use such cookies to make statements about recurring users. In this case, the utilisation of the data is only aggregated and never on the basis of a single user data set. It also cannot be assigned to the IP address of the client.</p>
			<p>Of course, through your browser configuration you can ensure that cookies can be placed (refer to the explanation in the previous section). Disabling cookies, as explained in the help function of your browser, can prevent HEALTHSTARS from optimally performing its service.</p>
			<p>HEALTHSTARS runs advertising in various forms (banners, pop-ups, etc.) on its own website and on third-party websites; to make the selection of the displayed advertising attractive and as relevant to interested visitors to the site as possible, a usage-related selection procedure is used for advertising placements. In so doing, data with usage information are stored on your hard drive via a cookie (“third-party cookie”). These usage profiles are anonymous and evaluated in a technical, statistical evaluation procedure, to later enable an advertising selection related to your interests. This procedure is also known as targeting. Targeting on our websites is operated by us and partly by third-party companies that also run advertising for other websites. By using cookies, these third-party companies then create the usage profiles referred to them and use their respective targeting systems to select the collected data for the purpose of user-oriented advertising.</p>

			<h3>Newsletters, emails and advertising</h3>
			<p>If we send you a newsletter on your request, this gives you information about HEALTHSTARS, and/or about our offers. You can unsubscribe the newsletter at any time via the unsubscribe link in the newsletter, without incurring additional costs other than the usual transmission costs at the basic rates.</p>
			<p>Over our service provider we include clear gifs in our HTML-formatted newsletters that we send to opt-in subscribers to determine the number of newsletters read and so be able to determine the interest in newsletter campaigns. An evaluation is carried out only in aggregated form so that an allocation to your person and thus a behaviour analysis is excluded.</p>
			<p>In addition, we send emails, which are necessary for the operation of HEALTHSTARS, such as “forgotten password emails”, “registration mail”, etc., for example.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, it may happen that HEALTHSTARS uses your data to send you information within the application that are oriented to your interests, such as targeted advertising. This improves the offering on the application and each member is provided with a tailor-made online offer.</p>

			<h3>Scalable Central Measurement Method (SZM)</h3>
			<p>HEALTHSTARS uses the “Scalable Central Measurement Method Next Generation /Skalierbare Zentrale Messverfahren next Generation” (SZMnG) of INFOnline GmbH (http://www.infonline.de) to determine the statistical characteristics for the use of our services. Measurements are collected anonymously.

IP addresses are only processed in anonymised form. </p>
			<p>The audience measurement was developed in compliance with data protection requirements. The goal of the audience measurement is to statistically determine user intensity and the number of users of a specific website. Individual users are not identified at any point in time. Your identity will always remain protected.</p>

For websites that are members of the IVW German Audit Bureau of Circulation (IVW – http://www.ivw.eu) or that participate in the study “Internet Facts” organised by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online-Forschung e.V. [Work Group Online Research] (AGOF – www.agof.de), user statistics are published monthly by the AGOF and the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Media-Analyse e.V. (ag.ma – www.agma-mmc.de), as well as the IVW and can be viewed at www.agof.de, www.agma-mmc.de and http://www.ivw.eu. In addition to the publication of measurement data, the IVW also regularly checks the SZM process to ensure that it is used according to regulations and in line with data protection.</p>
